"""
Centralized pipeline error handling (Task 9.3).

Every stage of the pipeline can fail without killing the whole request
or leaving the frontend with nothing to show. This gives every failure
a named `stage` (for the analytics event, Task 9.1) while keeping the
HTTP response's `detail` a plain string, since the frontend's ApiError
already renders `detail` directly as the user-facing message — changing
that shape would be a breaking change for no benefit here.
