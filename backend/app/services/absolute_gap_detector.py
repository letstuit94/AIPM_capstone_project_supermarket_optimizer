"""
Absolute (Bedarf vs. Ist) gap detection — iron, protein, calcium and
calories.

Rule-based, same spirit as gap_detector.py, but compares a real daily
estimate (intake_estimator.py, built from confirmed pantry consumption)
against a real daily requirement (nutrient_requirements.py) instead of a
density ratio. Returns no gap at all for a nutrient with not enough
pantry data to say anything — never fabricates a gap from an assumption,
matching this codebase's anti-hallucination stance (see recommender.py,
profile.py).

Calories are handled separately from the _NUTRIENTS table below (see
detect_calorie_gap): iron/protein/calcium are all "more is better, up to
the requirement" — a single one-sided LOW check. Calories aren't — being
below target can be the *goal* (a deficit) and being above it can too (a
surplus) — so calories need a goal-aware, two-sided (LOW or HIGH) check
instead of the generic table's one-sided assumption.
