Session-level adoption & nutrition-delta orchestration (Epic 8 v2
groundwork, Tasks 8.7/8.8).

Pulls a session's stored recommendations and receipts together and
applies the pure analytics/adoption_score.py + analytics/nutrition_delta.py
functions to them — kept separate so those stay unit-testable without a
DB, the same split services/nutrition_snapshot.py uses for Epic 4's pure
nutrition_model.py functions.
