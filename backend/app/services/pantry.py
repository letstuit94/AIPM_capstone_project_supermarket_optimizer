Pantry / running stock service (Lager-Bestand).

The pantry is cumulative, not a rolling time-window snapshot: every
receipt upload adds to it, and it only shrinks through an explicit user
action — confirming actual consumption or marking an item as no longer
available (thrown out, never really there). That confirmation *is* the
real intake signal consumed by intake_estimator.py; nothing here infers
consumption from purchase quantity or elapsed time.
