"""
Nutrition snapshot orchestrator (Epic 4 glue).

Builds a NutritionSnapshot by aggregating *all* saved receipts, not a
single one:

  - build_snapshot_from_db()      -> every row in receipt_items
  - build_snapshot_from_folder()  -> re-scan every image in a folder
  - build_snapshot(items, ...)    -> from an explicit item list
  - assemble_snapshot(items, matched, ...) -> offline core (no OFF/Gemini)

Pipeline per source: items -> Epic 2 mapping -> profile (4.2) -> gaps
(4.3) -> dimensions + confidence + disclaimer.
