"""
Next Cart recommendation engine (Task 5.2).

Turns Epic 4's gaps into exactly one prioritized, profile-safe grocery
action. Fully rule-based and deterministic — no LLM call, no randomness —
per the roadmap's explicit risk: "the LLM must not invent nutrition
facts." Every fact in the output (the gap message, the candidate's
rationale) is pulled verbatim from the recommendation mapping table
(Task 5.1) or Epic 4's own gap output; nothing is generated at runtime.

Algorithm: walk the gaps in the order Epic 4 ranked them (worst first),
and for each gap's candidate list (in the table's fixed order), keep the
first candidate the exclusion filter (Epic 3) allows. Same gaps + same
profile always yields the same recommendation.
