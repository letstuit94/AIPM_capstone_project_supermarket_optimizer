"""
Personalizes the protein reference baseline using weight, height,
gender and activity level, when a profile has enough of them.

Approach: Mifflin-St Jeor BMR x an activity-level TDEE multiplier gives
a personalized daily energy estimate; a goal-informed protein target
(g per kg bodyweight) divided by that TDEE gives a personalized protein
density (g per 1000 kcal) — directly comparable to the existing
PROTEIN_REF_PER_1000KCAL guideline, so gap_detector.py and
nutrition_model.py don't need two different units.

Fiber/sugar/processed stay as the existing universal density guidelines
(WHO/DGE), independent of body size — there's no widely-cited
weight-scaled version of those the way there is for protein.

Calories used to be deliberately excluded here too, for the same reason
as fiber/sugar/processed plus one more: comparing a receipt's estimated
total calories against a personalized daily TDEE needs to know how many
days that receipt covers, which a receipt alone doesn't carry (backlog
EXT-1/NUT-1). That problem is now solved differently — not by this
module, but by the confirmed-consumption pipeline (services/pantry.py,
intake_estimator.py) the absolute-gap nutrients (iron, protein, calcium)
already use, which gets a real per-day estimate from the user's own
consumption confirmations instead of guessing from a receipt. See
absolute_gap_detector.py's detect_calorie_gap for the calorie gap this
enables — personalized_tdee/personalized_calorie_target_kcal below only
compute the *requirement* side, same role as daily_protein_target_g.
