Easy swap suggestions: low-effort, cheap, in-season additions/swaps

deliberate Next Cart pick (recommender.py). Rule-based, reusing the same
candidate table (data/recommendations.json) and exclusion filter as Next
Cart; nothing here is a new fact, just a broader selection over the same
data, favoring effort/cost/season the single Next Cart pick doesn't
consider.
