"""
Receipt Comparison Engine (Task 8.6, v2).

Compares two receipts' item lists to find overlapping products. This is
groundwork for adoption scoring (Task 8.8): "did the item recommended
after receipt N actually turn up in receipt N+1?" — both files agree
this is v2 scope (deprecated/roadmap_consolidated.md), so it's built as a data-model
building block rather than a user-facing feature.

Uses the same token-aware fuzzy matcher as Task 2.2's product matching
(services/text_similarity.py) — no extra dependency, no LLM call, so
"overlap" stays a deterministic, explainable fact rather than a guess.

Bug fix: this originally scored matches with a raw whole-string
SequenceMatcher ratio, which badly under-scores a short recommended
item against a longer/differently-worded receipt entry — "Rote Linsen"
recommended, "Linsen" purchased, scored ~0.71 and was reported as NOT
adopted. Switched to the shared token-aware similarity used by the
product matcher, which scores that case ~0.85 and correctly detects it.
