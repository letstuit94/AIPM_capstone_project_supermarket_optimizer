"""
Analytics event logger (Task 9.1).

Logs the key pipeline events the roadmap calls out (upload_started,
upload_completed, parsing_success, match_rate, recommendation_viewed,
feedback_submitted) so drop-off and pipeline health can be reviewed
after a test session.

Fire-and-forget by design: analytics must never be the reason a request
fails. If the `events` table doesn't exist yet (e.g. before its
migration has been run) or the insert otherwise errors, this logs to
stdout instead rather than raising.
