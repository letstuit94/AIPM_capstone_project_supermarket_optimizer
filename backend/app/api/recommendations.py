    The single Next Cart recommendation (Epic 5), grounded in the
    aggregated gaps from Epic 4 across this session's saved receipts
    (scoped per Story 8.3), and constrained by the given profile's
    dietary pattern + exclusions (Epic 3).

    profile_id is optional: without one, a neutral no-exclusions profile
    is used so the endpoint still works before onboarding is complete.

    The computed recommendation is persisted (Task 8.5) so feedback
    (Task 8.2) has a stable `recommendation_id` to reference — otherwise
    "would you buy this?" would have nothing to point back to, since
    Next Cart is computed fresh on every call rather than stored ahead
