    Record "Would you consider buying this next time?" (Story 8.1).

    Requires the recommendation to actually exist (Task 8.2: traceable,
    not floating free) — a typo'd or made-up recommendation_id is
    rejected rather than silently stored.

    Bug fix (1): this used to ignore create_feedback_row's return value
    and always report success, even when the write silently failed (the
    `feedback` table missing in an unmigrated environment). Now a failed
    write is reported as a real error instead of a false "saved".

    Bug fix (2): recommendation_id is echoed back in plaintext by
    GET /next-cart, so any session that obtained one (browser history,
    a shared screenshot, a leaked log line) could previously submit
    feedback attributed to another session's recommendation — polluting
    the exact signal Story 8.1 exists to measure (whether a real user
    would act on it). Now restricted to the session that received the
    recommendation, same as the GDPR delete endpoints' ownership check.
