"""
OCR quality eval on the REAL receipt corpus (not the synthetic notebook image).

Runs the *production* extractor (backend/app/services/local_extractor.py) over
every real receipt file in receipts/ and measures how well the raw OCR text
recovers the hand-labelled line items in receipts/receipts_queries.json. This is
OCR *recall* — the ceiling for everything downstream (matching, nutrition). It
says nothing about the structured parser or the matching quality itself.

Use it as a regression guard: mean recall should stay high, and any receipt that
drops into the "LOW" bucket is an OCR problem worth eyeballing (start with its
dump in ml/ocr_raw_text/).

There is no filename -> receipt_id column in the labels, so each file is
auto-mapped to the receipt whose `name_original` items best survive in its OCR
text (item-overlap), and per item we ask: does the labelled `name_original`
fuzzy-appear somewhere in the OCR output?

History: this harness was written to diagnose 6 landscape phone photos that
OCR'd to pure noise (missing EXIF orientation). The confidence-based
orientation recovery that fixed them now lives in local_extractor._ocr, so this
eval reports the CURRENT production pipeline (fix included). Baseline back then
was 61.8% mean recall; with the fix it is ~93%.

Usage:
    .venv/bin/python3 ml/ocr_eval.py
Outputs:
    ml/ocr_eval_results.json   (structured per-file results)
    ml/ocr_raw_text/<file>.txt (raw OCR dump per file, for eyeballing)
